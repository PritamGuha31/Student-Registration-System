    <p align='left'>Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) is an engineering entrance examination conducted for admission to various engineering colleges in India. It is constituted by two different examinations - JEE Main and the JEE Advanced. The exams are of the objective pattern. JEE Advanced is regarded internationally as one of the most challenging undergraduate admission tests.

In 2012, the government-run Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) that earlier conducted the AIEEE, announced the JEE that replaced the AIEEE and IIT-JEE. The JEE-Main, which replaces AIEEE, is for admission to the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and some other colleges designated as "centrally funded technical institutes" (CFTIs) The JEE-Advanced, which replaces IIT-JEE, is for admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Only the students selected in JEE Mains are eligible for appearing in JEE Advanced. About 2,24,000 Top students will be selected from 2018.

There are some institutes like the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, and the Indian Institute of Science which use the score obtained in JEE Advanced as the basis for admission. These are not participating institutes of central IIT JEE Advanced counseling of which all IITs are members. Any student who takes admission to IITs cannot appear for the JEE-Advanced exam in the next year, but the same is not the case with IISc, IISER, RGIPT and other institutes as these institutes only use JEE Advanced score for admission.

In September 2013, the IIT Council approved the decision of the Joint Admission Board to continue with the two-phase JEE pattern ("Main" followed by "Advanced") for IITs in 2014. Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA) conducted the joint admission process for a total of 23 IITs, ISM, 32 NITs, 18 IIITs and 19 other Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs).[1][2]

As per the reports from Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) of Government of India, the government is considering to conduct only one common engineering entrance test based on the lines of NEET for all engineering colleges, including private institutions, across India.</p>
<br>
<p>JEE Main has two papers, Paper-1 and Paper-2. Candidates may opt for either or both of them. Both papers contain multiple choice questions. Paper 1 is for admission to B.E./B.Tech courses and is conducted in both online and offline modes. Paper-2 is for admission in B.Arch and B.Planning courses and is conducted offline only.

JEE Main, unlike JEE Advanced, has a fixed exam structure and is not subject to change every year. Paper-1 is of three hours duration and consists of thirty multiple-choice (single-correct) questions in each of the three subjects (physics, chemistry, and maths). There is negative marking for incorrect answers. 4 marks are awarded for correct answers and 1 mark is deducted for incorrect answers.

From 2013 to 2016, the marks obtained in the class XII school board examination used to be accorded a 40% weightage in deciding the JEE Main all India ranks.[4][5]

From 2017, CBSE made Aadhar card mandatory for students applying for JEE. Students not having the card were asked to register for it before applying for JEE.</p>
<br>
<p>In 2016, the JEE Advanced exam was held on May 22, 2016. The exam carried a total of 372 marks with each paper carrying 186 marks. The level of difficulty of questions was increased to a larger extent. Moreover, number of integer type questions (having no negative marking) were reduced. The paper was set up in collaboration of different IITs with the principal organiser being the IIT Guwahati. The Physics paper was set by IIT Madras, Mathematics by IIT Guwahati and the Chemistry portion was jointly set by IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi. These features made this paper the toughest ever JEE Paper till date. The paper had a huge surprise of partial marking in multiple correct choices where if a student marked some but not all correct answers without marking the wrong ones, he/she would be awarded one mark for each correct option</p>
